Penguin Books: London, 1996. pp.142-145</ref>]]\n\n'''World''' is a common name for the whole of [[human]] [[civilization]], specifically human [[experience]], [[history]], or the [[human condition]] in general, ''worldwide'', i.e. anywhere on [[Earth]]<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-webster.com]</ref> or pertaining to anywhere on earth.\n\nIn a philosophical context it may refer to:\n# the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or \n# an [[ontology|ontological]] world (''see [[world disclosure]]'').\nIn a theological context, ''world'' usually refers to the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \"[[Eschatology|end of the world]]\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts.\n\n[[World history]] is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the  [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present.\n\n[[World population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies (all countries), especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms like [[world championship]], [[gross world product]], [[world flags]] etc. also imply the sum or combination of all current-day [[sovereign state]]s.\n\nIn terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], ''world'' suggests international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of the entire world.\n\nIn terms such as [[world map]] and [[world climate]], ''world'' is used in the sense detached from human culture or civilization, referring to the planet [[Earth]] physically.\n\n==Etymology and usage==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of  ''[[were|wer]]'' \"man\" and ''eld'' \"age,\" which thus means roughly \"Age of Man.\"<ref>[http://.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ]</ref>\nThe Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-al\u0111iz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old High German]]  ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''ver\u01ebld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:ver\u00f6ld|ver\u00f6ld]]'').<ref>Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. ISBN 90-04-12875-1.</ref>\n\nThe corresponding word in [[Latin]]  is ''mundus'', literally \"clean, elegant\", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' \"orderly arrangement.\" While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a \"domain of Man\" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].\n\n'World' distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.\n\n'World' was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: \"The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them.\" <ref>{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|subscription=yes}} </ref> The earth was often described as 'the center of the world'.<ref>e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>'</nowiki>''World''<nowiki>'</nowiki> can also be used attributively, to mean 'global', 'relating to the whole world', forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.<ref>[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]</ref> \n\nBy extension, a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''world''<nowiki>'</nowiki> may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].\n\n<nowiki>'</nowiki>''World''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, in  original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].\n\n* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of  [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.\n* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].\n* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as [[New World monkey]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (c. 1503) shows the \"garden\" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]\n\nIn philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century<ref>{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1982 |page=165 |isbn=0-253-17686-7 }}.</ref> and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.\n\n;Parmenides\nThe traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the every-day perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.\n\n;Plato\nIn his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds : the sensible world and the intelligible world.\n\n;Hegel\nIn [[Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.\n\n;Schopenhauer\n''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].\nSchopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.\n\n;Wittgenstein\nTwo definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. \"The world is everything that is the case,\" wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1922. This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.\n\n;Heidegger\n[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that \"the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world\".<ref>Heidegger (1982), p. 164.</ref> The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already \"thrown\" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of \"[[world disclosure]]\" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.\n\n;Freud\nIn response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.\n\n;Other\nSome philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].\n\n==Religion and mythology==\n[[Image:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]\n[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered around an [[axis mundi]] and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[J\u00f6rmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}) is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.\n\n===Buddhism===\nIn [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.\n\n===Christianity===\nIn [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be \"''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world\"\u2014as [[Jesus]] said, and the term \"worldhood\" has been distinguished from \"monkhood\", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with \"worldly\" things.\n\nThis view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':\n{{quote|\"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruld\u00f0inga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices.\"}}\n\nAlthough Hebrew and Greek words meaning \"world\" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].\n\n''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.<ref>[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi]</ref> This view has been criticized as a \"pastoral of fear\" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'', ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]''.\n\n====Eastern Christianity====\nIn Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]] the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore the passions of the World are simply called \"the world\". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].\n\n====Orbis Catholicus====\n''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Environment}}\n* [[Globe]]\n* [[List of sovereign states]]\n* [[Universe]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|World}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline|World}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook link|xx|World}}\n\n[[Category:World| ]]\n[[Category:Earth]]"}]}}}}
